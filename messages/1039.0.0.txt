Happy New Year!

I'm excited to announce the addition of a new pass called "AlignSuperEquals", which enables you to align your code like this:

$a    .= 1;
$bb    = 22;
$ccc  &= 333;
$d   <<= 1;

I would greatly appreciate your support by starring the package on GitHub! ðŸ˜‰

Thank you for your time and support.
